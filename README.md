# Before Linux Workshops

I'm glad you took the chance to learn more about Linux; 

I'll use this opportunity to guide you on the steps required from my experience in order to have a solid foundation in Linux.

Let's put it in steps and i'll link you in each:


## 1- Get Familiar With The Command Line
- Learn the fundamental commands and structure of the Linux command line. Navigating the file system, manipulating files and directories, and running programs are all component of this. 

You can refer to my article [here](https://blog.yahya-abulhaj.dev/gitgithub-workflow-in-80-seconds). It will also introduce you to GitHub and Git.

## 2- Permissions and Priviliges
- Learn and Recognize the significance of file permissions and user management in Linux. 

This is necessary for system security and ensuring that only authorized users have access to specific resources.

## 3- Get Familiar Shell Scripting and Automation
- Learn how to use shell scripts to automate tasks and maintain your system. 

Shell scripts are a powerful tool for combining multiple commands into a single script that can be executed automatically.

I wrote this [article specifically for you](https://blog.yahya-abulhaj.dev/mastering-python-and-bash-for-next-level-automation). It explains a lot about automation, from Bash to Python.

Once finished, you can go further and try some [Shell Exercices from here](https://github.com/Y4HYA4/UniversityLabs/blob/main/TryShellYourself.pdf).

## 4- Master The Command Line Text Editors
Learn how to use the various text editors available in Linux, such as vi and emacs, and become familiar with them.

## 4- Next-Level Workshops
After completing the preceding four points, you should be ready to move on to more advanced scenarios.

NOW, experiment with different commands and options by using the command line.

This is true for these workshops. Here you will become acquainted with applying the above knowledge in real-world scenarios such as OS installation and configuration. You will simuate your own OS as well.

This will help you become more comfortable with using the command line and allow you to better understand how Linux works. Good luck, and remember to enjoy the process.
